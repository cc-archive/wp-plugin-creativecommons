## Features

### Setting a Default Site License

After activating the plugin, head to **Settings > Creative Commons** to set up the default license.

![Plugin Settings](https://cl.ly/01ae314c5c57/img)

Selecting a license is simple. Select one from the given
CC licenses, by default [**CC BY-SA**](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)
license is used.

![Select License](https://cl.ly/bfd84b912c78/img)

There are multiple options available for the license. You
can add:

- Additional attribution text for a custom note.
- Title and Title URL. If not mentioned it defaults to "the content".
- Author and Author URL. If not mentioned it defaults to "on this site".
- Display options.

### Widget

There are two options to display the default license, as
a widget or in the footer. We recommend using the widget for better theme compatibility.

After selecting the widget go to **Appearance > Widgets**
and drag the CC License Widget to the
required area. The widget will then display the default license on all pages of the site.

### Gutenberg Blocks

The plugin adds specific Gutenberg blocks for each Creative
Commons license. If you are using the default Gutenberg editor,
you will find these blocks under a seperate category.

These blocks can be used to license any page/post/image or
other media.

## Contributing

## Development

If you're interested in the code have a look at the master branch for the
releases. Development will be done in the development branch.

Occasionally other branches may be available to test new features or play with
new ideas, but they may be deleted anytime so don't rely on those branches.


## History

This plugin is loosely based on an existing, but seemingly abandoned WordPress
plugin named 'License' (a component of the [MIT Educational Collaboration
Space][collabspace] project) by mitcho (Michael Yoshitaka Erlewine) and
Brett Mellor. We're also inspired by Creative Commons' original
[wordpress-cc-plugin][oldplugin] written by former Creative Commons CTO Nathan
Yergler.
